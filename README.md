# Molecular-Docking--I 

> (Docking of Antioxidants ligands like (D-Limonene, p-Cymene, Î³ - Terpinene which is present in Celery Seeds) with target bcl - 2 family, this bcl - 2 is a target protein in Colon Cancer).

### MOLECULAR DOCKING: Molecular docking is a computational drug design method that can be used to study how molecules bind to target proteins. It's used in drug discovery to explore various types of cancer, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma
